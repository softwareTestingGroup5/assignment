# Testing project
## Purpose of this repository

This is a testing project based on a template provided by course staff on Software Testing course at Tampere University.

The repository contains source code of the library to be tested and tests in separate directories. There's also `package.json` for building the project.
 
Source code folder contains a separate license file that must **NOT** be removed under any circumstances!
Removing this license file directly violates terms and conditions of the software under testing.
